This is my Mini Core Java project 

In this awt,swing libraray of java is used for front end and MySql is used for Database storage.


To intsall it in your local machine , first you have to download jdk,netbeans,xampp(for sql file).

After installing all the above software you should download repository zip file and extract it and all files in one folder.

Now you have to add that project folder on netbeans and then you will be able to see all the source code software and to run the project you should first import sql file on local host. To do so you should run xampp on your pc and start apache and sql service then your local phpmyadmin page will appear ,now just import schooldb.sql file  there and run project on netbeans.
